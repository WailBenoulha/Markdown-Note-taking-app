# My Personal Diary

Today was a great day! I has a lot of fun with my friends. We goes to the park and played games.

## Activities

1. **Go to the park** - We spend time there from 3pm to 5pm.
2. **Play football** - I kicked the ball very hardly and scored a goal.
3. **Have a lunch** - Me and my friends ate pizza in a resturant nearby.

## Thoughts

I feel very happy today. This was one of the best day in a long time. I'm really look forward to tomorrow!
